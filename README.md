# Deadlines

The app is designed to visualize how much time has past since the start of the task, and is used to remind the user about upcoming deadlines. The deadlines
are sorted in an increasing order by date and there is a progress bar relative to the start time of the task. User can choose to receive a notification 
about the deadline prior to the due date.
